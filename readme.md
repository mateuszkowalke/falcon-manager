### TODO

 - [ ] graph.h - bfs!!!

 - [ ] queue.h - make it copy data? Currently the data is not being copied because on dequeue we're freeing the node (if we make the implementation copy the data, we need to simply return that data from function instead of returning 0 or 1, which makes writing while loops easier).
